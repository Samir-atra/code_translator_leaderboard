      "reasoning": "Aggregated Score across 3 test cases.\n\nDetails:\n[1/3] Winner: translator. The Javascript translation is excellent. It accurately replicates the functionality and logic of the Python code, using idiomatic Javascript array methods (.filter and .map) for a concise and readable solution. The JSDoc comment is a good equivalent to the Python docstring. The code is clean, error-free, and directly relevant to the original task.\n\n[2/3] Winner: translator. The JavaScript translation accurately reflects the Python code's functionality and structure, implementing the Fibonacci sequence with memoization. It is syntactically correct and runs without errors. The code is concise and relevant to the problem of calculating Fibonacci numbers. The style is appropriate for JavaScript, though adding comments would improve it further.\n\n[3/3] Winner: translator. The JavaScript code successfully translates the Python function. It maintains the same functionality, logic, and structure. The regular expression is correctly adapted for JavaScript, and the code is clean, concise, and relevant. The comments are also preserved."
